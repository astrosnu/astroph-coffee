    <p>Every Tuesday, the astro folks at Seoul National University
      gathers in <strong>Bldg. 19's Rm. 206</strong> to discuss the
      latest <a href="/astroph-coffee/papers/today">arXiv astro-ph</a> posting
      at <strong>10:00 AM</strong> over
      coffee. This <a href="/astroph-coffee/about">astro-coffee server</a> is 
      meant to help organize the discussion. It automatically finds and
      highlights papers from local authors, and allows the community to vote for
      articles they want to talk about. New paper listings are fetched from the
      arXiv between 00:25 and 00:35 UTC Monday through Friday during the
      week.</p>

    <p>Currently, voting on papers is open between
      <strong>12:00 AM</strong> before and <strong>09:00 AM</strong>
      the morning of astroph meeting. Everyone gets five votes (one per paper) to
      use as they please.</p>
